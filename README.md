Madness Kombat

This is a 2D local PVP shooter game made in Java for fun. The game is intended to be played only on one computer with one or more keyboards; it does not support online or LAN multiplayer. Took about a total of 3 months to make. No external game development libraries or engines are used; it is purely programmed in Java. All graphics are self-made. The sound effects are mostly from freesound.org; some of them are from Youtube. However, the main soundtrack, made in Studio One 2, is completely original. This can be used as a reference for an introduction to game development(e.g students who are taking the grade 11 or 12 Comp Sci course).

Features:
  1. Game structure(menu, settings, gameplay, etc)
  2. Simple 2D collision and physics
  3. Usage of graphics and texture
  4. Create, edit, and use 2D map for battle stages in game
  5. Read & write game settings
  6. Sound effects and looped soundtrack
  7. Some bugs and errors
  
Launch the game by running /src/Main/GamePanel.java

(WARNING: code in the Multiplayer package DOES NOT WORK AT ALL WHATSOEVER!! It was an extremely poor attempt at trying to make the game an online multiplayer)
