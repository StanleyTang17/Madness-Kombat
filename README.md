# Madness Kombat

This is a 2D local PVP shooter game made in Java for fun. The game is intended to be played only on one computer with one or more keyboards; it does not support online or LAN multiplayer. This game took about a total of 3 months to make. No external game development libraries or engines are used; it is purely programmed in Java. All graphics are self-made. The sound effects are mostly from freesound.org while some of them are from Youtube. The main soundtrack is composed by me in Studio One 2 over the course of 2 months. This project can be used as a reference for an introduction to game development (e.g students who are taking a Computer Science course in highschool), but is definitely not a refined product.

## Features
  1. Game structure (menu, settings, gameplay, etc)
  2. Simple 2D collision and physics
  3. Usage of AWT graphics and textures
  4. Creating, editing, and loading a map
  5. Reading and writing game settings
  6. Sound effects and an original soundtrack (looped in-game)
  7. Some bugs and errors

## How to Play
Download the zip file in the `Download` folder, extract it, and run the executable.

**Note:** keep the map files and the configs file in the same folder as the executable!

## Multiplayer
There was an attempt to make this multiplayer...turns out that in order to do that, the game has to be redesigned from scratch. Thus, the code in the Multiplayer package DOES NOT WORK AT ALL WHATSOEVER!!
